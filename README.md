Music Cleanup Tool 

*Purpose* 

Pass through multiple directories storing music files. This project was written a while back but I've now decided to host it as it's been a useful tool for me multiple times. Hopefully it treats you well :-)
Thanks to the folks at [AtlDotNet](https://github.com/Zeugma440/atldotnet) as they made this quick project possible. 
At the time it was not possible to update/mess around with the metadata so a modified version has been provided respecting their license, I also added extra support for different playlist types IIRC.

*Remember: due to the nature of the app, and the posibility that things don't go right - run it at your own risk*

*Requirements* 

.Net Core 2+
